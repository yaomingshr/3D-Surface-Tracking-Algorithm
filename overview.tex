\section{Introduction}

This algorithm constructs a surface model from edge voxels. A voxel is
identified as being on the surface if its second derivative is negative and
changes sign for neighbors in the gradient direction. By this definition, there
can only exist one layer of surface voxels, and the tracking algorithm is simply
a breadth-first search. Moreover, the definition of surface voxels is not
sensitive to gradient directions, thus this approach is robust against
noise. The test results on real data are also reported.
